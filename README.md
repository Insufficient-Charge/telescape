Welcome to Telescape
=================

Telescape is a project created for Google CSSI using p5.js with Google's Teachable Machine. This game will use image recognition in order to control a platform while an autonomous character moves across the screen. The goal is to use the platform-mechanics to guide the autonomous character to all keys and goals.
